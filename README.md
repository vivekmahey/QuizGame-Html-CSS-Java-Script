# Quiz Game Web Application
This project is a simple yet interactive quiz game web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to answer multiple-choice questions and receive immediate feedback on their answers.

## How It Works

### HTML Structure (`index.html`)
- The HTML file defines the basic structure of the quiz game.
- Each question is encapsulated within a `div` with the class `ques`.
- Radio buttons are used for the answer options, each paired with a label for better styling and accessibility.
- Navigation buttons ("Previous" and "Next") allow users to move between questions.
- A score display shows the user's total score at the top.

### CSS Styling (`style.css`)
- The CSS file applies styling to make the quiz visually appealing and responsive.
- It includes styles for the overall layout, question containers, radio buttons, and navigation buttons.
- Custom styles are applied to the radio buttons to enhance their appearance and interactivity.
- Responsive design ensures the quiz looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

### JavaScript Functionality (`script.js`)
- The JavaScript code handles the interactivity of the quiz.
- It includes a slider function to smoothly transition between questions.
- Event listeners are attached to radio buttons to detect when an answer is selected.
- When an answer is selected, the script checks if it is correct, updates the score, and displays feedback.
- The score is dynamically updated and displayed at the top of the page.
- Options are disabled after a selection to prevent multiple attempts.
